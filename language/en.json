                        On the one hand, ConceptMappR is intended for <strong>students</strong> to facilitate constructive learning processes by analyzing their own concept maps and comparing them to other maps.
                        To ensure flexibility, this 'comparison map' can be any concept map: It can be a map a student created at an earlier stage (e.g., before a learning unit), a map of a colleague on the same subject or a curated 'expert map' provided by a teacher.

                        One the other hand, ConceptMappR is intended for <strong>teachers</strong>. 
                        The dashboard allows to upload multiple maps (e.g., a set of maps created by a class) to create an aggregated map, highlighting unique, shared, and critical nodes and providing a way to investigate how the network structure of a class might look like.

                        <strong>Concept maps</strong> are a method of visually organizing knowledge to stimulate deep, constructive learning processes on the one hand, and to capture learners' knowledge and misconceptions on the other: 
                        They can thus be both a support method and a formative assessment method.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Concept maps visualize concepts and their relationships as a <strong>network</strong> of <strong>nodes</strong> (also 'vertices') connected by <strong>edges</strong> (also 'lines' or 'arrows').
                        The difference to mind maps is that all relationships must be justified and multiple central nodes may exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For illustration, the following figure shows an articial concept map with nodes 'NodeA', 'NodeB' and 'NodeC' connected by the edges 'Edge1', 'Edge2' and 'Edge3':

                        Using concept maps is challenging for teachers due to difficulties in interpretation and costly analysis. 
                        Current analysis methods involve heuristics and subjective impressions, making it challenging and non-scalable, particularly in large classes. 
                        As concept maps represent networks, this dashboard assists learners and teachers in evaluating concept maps, using network analysis methods for a more objective assessment.

            "text": "<p>
                        If you draw your concept map with ConceptMappR, you do not have to worry about file formats, since the exported file can be analyzed without any adjustment (see <a href='#box6'>Draw</a>). 
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        However, if you create your map any other way, these are the <strong>file formats</strong> that are currently supported:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Text files</strong> with file extensions <strong>*.csv, *.tsv*</strong>, and <strong>*.txt</strong> with columns separated by semicolon (;), comma (,) or tabulator (example files: <a href='primary.csv'>Primary</a> / <a href='comparison.csv'>Comparison</a>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft Excel files</strong> with file extension <strong>*.xlsx.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><a href='https://cmap.ihmc.us/' target='_blank'>CmapTools</a> files</strong> with file extension <strong>*.cxl.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The basic structure of the text and Excel files is a so-called edge list.
                        Importantly, they must contain exactly <strong>three to four columns</strong> and have <strong>no header</strong> (i.e., no column names).
                        Let us illustrate the file structure with the following artificial map:
                    </p>
                    <center><img id ='imageFile1' src='fileformat1.png' style='width: 50%; max-width: 200px; height: auto'></center>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>first</strong> column contains the names of the <strong>'source' nodes</strong> (i.e., 'NodeA', 'NodeB', 'NodeC').</li>
                    <li>The <strong>second</strong> column contains the <strong>labels of the edges</strong> connecting the nodes mentioned in the first and third columns (i.e., 'Edge1', 'Edge2', 'Edge3'). 
                        The edge label can also be an empty string.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>third</strong> column contains the names of the <strong>'target' nodes</strong> (i.e., 'NodeB', 'NodeC', 'NodeA')</li>
                    <li>The <strong>fourth</strong> column is optional. 
                        It can be used to specify the direction of the edges. 
                        When the value is <strong>'0'</strong> (or when no text or no fourth column is provided), the edge is drawn without arrowheads.
                        When the value is <strong>'1'</strong>, an arrow from the source to the target node is drawn. 
                        When the value is <strong>'2'</strong>, a bidirectional arrow is drawn.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Thus, the above concept map would look like this in tabular format (example files: <a href='map.csv'>*.csv</a> / <a href='map.xlsx'>*.xlsx</a>):

                        One major obstacle in analyzing concept maps in teaching, especially in larger classrooms, is the lack of a seamless integration between drawing and analyzing.
                        ConceptMappR includes <strong>basic drawing functionality</strong> directly in the dashboard under <a id='linkToTabDraw2' href='#' class='action-button'>Draw</a> (but see below for dedicated drawing software).
                        This is how it works:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click on <strong>'Add Node'</strong> and on an empty space to create a new node.</li>
                        <li>Click on <strong>'Add Edge'</strong> and draw a line from one node to another to create a new edge.</li>                        
                        <li>Select a node and click on <strong>'Edit Node'</strong> to edit the <strong>label</strong>, <strong>size</strong> or <strong>color</strong> of a node.</li>
                        <li>Select an edge and click on <strong>'Edit Edge'</strong> to add / edit the <strong>label</strong>, <strong>arrowheads</strong> (<i>'0'</i> for no arrowheads, <i>'1'</i> for arrows from source to the target node , <i>'2'</i> for bidirectional arrows), <strong>width</strong> and <strong>color</strong> of an edge.</li>
                        <li>Select a node or an edge and click on <strong>'Delete selected'</strong> to remove it.</li>
                		<li><strong>Shortcuts</strong>: <i>'N'</i> to add nodes, <i>'E'</i> to add edges, <i>'double click'</i> on nodes / edges to edit, <i>'D'</i> to remove the selected nodes / edges</li>
                        <li>We highly recommend using a device with a larger screen, mouse and keyboard. When <strong>drawing on a mobile phone</strong> or smaller screen, you can click on the 
                            <i class='fa fa-bars' aria-hidden='true'></i>
                            button to make the canvas bigger.

                        <br>
                        The dashboard also provides two options to help you <strong>setting up your drawing</strong>. 
                        First, you can <strong>upload a list of nodes</strong> (example files: <a href='nodes.csv'>*.csv</a> / <a href='nodes.xlsx'>*.xlsx</a>) which will populate the canvas with nodes allowing you to focus on drawing the connections. 
                        Second, you can also <strong>upload an existing concept map</strong> (see <a href='#box4'>Import (Upload)</a>) which you then can edit.
                        Importantly, you can <strong>download</strong> your map</strong> by selecting the <strong>Output File/s</strong> and clicking on <strong>'Download'</strong> (see <a href='#box5'>Export (Download)</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two options to <strong>analyze your drawing</strong>: 
                        In the 'Analyze' tab, you can either upload the exported Map Structure (*.cxl) or Edge List (*.xlsx).
                        Alternatively, you can directly retrieve the current drawing without the intermediate export step (see 'Analyze: General' in the Readme).</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another option to draw concept maps is to use a <strong>dedicated software</strong> such as <a href='https://cmap.ihmc.us/' target='_blank'>CmapTools</a>. 
                        CmapTools is freely available, runs on most major platforms, and even provides a <a href='https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us/' target='_blank'>cloud-based version</a> that can be used without installation. 
                        However, please be aware that the cloud-based version will store your data on their servers.
                        To keep the hurdles as small as possible, you can export your Cmaptools map as a *.cxl file which can then directly be imported into ConceptMappR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, sometimes nothing beats <strong>drawing on paper or using the software you know</strong>.
                        In these cases, you can still use ConceptMappR if you are willing to translate the map into the formats outlined in the box 'Import (Upload)' or to redraw your map with ConceptMappR.

                        Optionally, you can also <strong>upload a single Comparison File</strong> to which the Primary File(s) are then compared to.
                        Once you click on <strong>'Analyze'</strong>, the dashboard will perform the analysis and restructure depending on whether a single Primary File, multiple Primary Files, and a Comparison File was uploaded.

                        The <strong>main area on the right</strong> now shows several <strong>colored boxes</strong>.
                        These will include information about the number of nodes, isolates (unconnected nodes), edge, and the density of the network.
                        In each box, the values of the Primary File(s) are shown on the left and the values of the Comparison file (if available) on the right. 
                        More information will appear when moving your mouse cursor over each box.

                       The <strong>main area on the right</strong> also shows up to two <strong>interactive plots</strong> of your concept maps.
                       In these plots, you can move and select nodes and edges as well as zoom in and out.
                       The size of the nodes corresponds to the centrality measure you have selected (see <a href='#box8'>Analysis: Centrality</a>) and 
                       the thickness of the edges corresponds to the number of files containing each edge.
                       Nodes that are unique to the Primary File(s), i.e. that do not appear in the Comparison File (and vice versa), are displayed as orange squares. 
                       Similarly, unique edges are displayed as orange, dashed lines.

                        The <strong>main area on the right</strong> shows one or several <strong>interactive tables</strong>.
                        In these tables, you can sort and filter the data as required.
                        The <strong>'Centrality' table</strong> shows the centrality of each node and if available, the (absolute) difference between the Primary File(s) and the Comparison File.
                        The <strong>'Analysis by File' table</strong> shows for each Primary File how many nodes and edges are shared with the Comparison File.
                        The <strong>'Analysis by Nodes' table </strong> and <strong>'Analysis by Edges' table</strong> show for each node or edge how often they appear across all Primary Files.
                        More information about each column will appear when moving your mouse cursor over the column names.

                             It can be seen seen as a measure of dependence of a network on a given node.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closeness Centrality: </strong>This is the inverse of the sum of all shortest paths between each node and all other nodes in your map.

                        The values in the Comparison File are seen as the 'reference' and thus are never changed. 
                        When uploading multiple Primary Files, they are matched individually to the Comparison File; they are never matched to each other.</p>
                     <p>These are the available options:</p>

                                <strong>'Case Insensitive'</strong>: Nodes and edges are matched even if they differ in case (e.g., 'protein' is matched to 'Protein')
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                This option uses the Levenshtein distance to count the number of deletions, insertions, and substitutions that are necessary to turn the values from the Primary File(s) into the values of the Comparison File.
                            </p>

                                The suboption <strong>'Max. Distance'</strong> allows setting the maximally allowed distance.
                                For example, if the distance is set 1, 'DNA' and 'DNS' will be matched, since the former can be changed into the latter by substituting the letter 'A' with a 'S'.
